# mtg-card-drawer
Reads a .txt file generated by MTGA game, containing all cards from a deck. Shuffles the deck and downloads the cards' images. The objective is to see how you would draw a random hand in a deck, to help you judge if the deck is good or not.

# How to use this code? 
1. Create a .txt file in the main folder.
2. Go to MTGA, select a deck of yours, and copy it to the clipboard.
3. Paste it into the .txt file, and remove the 'Deck' word (first line of what you copied into the clipboard), and remove all lines below your main deck (this code has no support for reading your side deck).
4. Open main.py and change the text inside the 'nome_deck' variable to whatever name you gave to your .txt file (but do not include the .txt extension in this string).
5. Save main.py and run :)

This code will take time to run the first time you run a deck through it, because it downloads all the images of its cards. But the following times it wont take long.
